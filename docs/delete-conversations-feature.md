# Delete Conversations Feature

## Overview

The Delete Conversations feature allows users to permanently remove conversations from the system. This feature includes both API endpoints and UI functionality for managing conversation lifecycle.

## API Endpoint

### DELETE /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}

Deletes a conversation by its ID. This operation is permanent and cannot be undone.

**Parameters:**
- `conversation_id` (path parameter): The UUID4 identifier of the conversation to delete

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer {token}` (required): Authentication token

**Response Codes:**
- `204 No Content`: Conversation deleted successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid conversation ID format
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
- `403 Forbidden`: Access denied to conversation (user doesn't own it)
- `404 Not Found`: Conversation not found

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/conversations/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-token"
```

**Example Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## UI Features

### Conversation Management Interface

The conversations list now includes delete functionality:

1. **Delete Button**: Each conversation item displays a trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è) button
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm deletion with a warning about permanence
3. **Success Feedback**: Success messages are shown after successful deletion
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed deletions
5. **Auto-refresh**: The conversations list automatically refreshes after deletion

### User Experience

- **Visual Design**: Delete buttons are subtle but accessible with hover effects
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Safety**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

1. **Access Control**: Validates user ownership before deletion
2. **Data Cleanup**: Removes both conversation data and access control records
3. **Checkpoint Clearing**: Attempts to clear LangGraph checkpoint data
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Event Handling**: Prevents event bubbling to avoid accidental selection
2. **Network Management**: Uses existing network retry and error handling
3. **State Management**: Refreshes conversation list after successful deletion
4. **User Feedback**: Shows loading states and success/error messages

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Only conversation owners can delete their conversations
2. **Input Validation**: Conversation IDs are validated for proper UUID4 format
3. **Audit Trail**: Access attempts are logged for security monitoring
4. **Permanent Deletion**: No soft delete - data is permanently removed

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: API endpoint testing with various scenarios
- **Access Control**: Tests for unauthorized access attempts
- **Error Handling**: Tests for invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Success Cases**: Tests for successful deletion workflows

## Usage Examples

### API Usage

```python
import requests

# Delete a conversation
response = requests.delete(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/conversations/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer dev-token"}
)

if response.status_code == 204:
    print("Conversation deleted successfully")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.json()}")
```

### UI Usage

1. Open the conversations list by clicking the üìã button
2. Find the conversation you want to delete
3. Click the üóëÔ∏è button next to the conversation
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
5. The conversation will be removed and the list will refresh

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the delete feature:

1. **Bulk Deletion**: Allow deleting multiple conversations at once
2. **Soft Delete**: Option to restore deleted conversations within a time window
3. **Archive Mode**: Alternative to deletion for long-term storage
4. **Deletion History**: Track what was deleted and when
5. **Admin Override**: Allow administrators to delete any conversation
