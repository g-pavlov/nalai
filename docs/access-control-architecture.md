# Access Control Architecture

## Executive Overview

### The Problem We Solve

When deploying AI assistants in enterprise environments, organizations face a critical challenge: **how to enable multiple users to interact with the same AI system while ensuring complete data privacy and meeting strict regulatory requirements**.

Traditional AI deployments either:
- **Isolate users completely** (separate instances per user) - expensive and complex to manage
- **Share everything** (single instance) - violates privacy and compliance requirements
- **Ignore the problem** - creates security and compliance risks

### Our Solution

The API Assistant provides **secure concurrent multi-user access** where multiple users can simultaneously use the same AI system while maintaining complete data isolation and meeting enterprise compliance standards.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Private Conversations**: Each user's conversations are completely isolated - no data leakage between users
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Works with any enterprise identity provider (Auth0, Keycloak, Azure AD, etc.)
- **Compliance Ready**: Built-in audit trails and data protection for SOC 2, GDPR, and ISO 27001
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with no external dependencies

### Business Value

**For Organizations**:
- **Cost Effective**: Single AI system serves multiple users without expensive per-user deployments
- **Compliance Safe**: Built-in audit trails and data protection meet regulatory requirements
- **Enterprise Ready**: Integrates with existing identity systems and security infrastructure
- **Developer Friendly**: Zero-configuration startup with optional enterprise scaling

**For Users**:
- **ChatGPT-like Experience**: Natural conversation threads that persist across sessions
- **Complete Privacy**: No risk of data exposure to other users
- **Seamless Access**: Works with existing enterprise authentication

### Current Status: **Production Ready**
- ✅ **497 unit tests** with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ **All core components** implemented and integrated
- ✅ **Zero-configuration startup** - works immediately
- ✅ **Enterprise-ready** - supports external auth systems (Istio/K8s)

### Key Achievements
- **Secure multi-user isolation** with explicit thread validation
- **Lightweight defaults** that work out-of-the-box
- **Optional external backends** for enterprise scaling
- **Comprehensive audit trail** for compliance
- **Middleware-based integration** for seamless security

## Scope & Constraints

### What This Architecture Covers
- **User authentication** via OIDC/JWT with any provider
- **Thread-level access control** ensuring users only access their own data
- **Identity-aware caching** with user-scoped keys
- **Audit logging** with dedicated security event tracking and PII masking
- **Runtime configuration** with access validation
- **Compliance features** for regulatory requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001)

### What This Architecture Does NOT Cover
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) - future enhancement
- **Multi-tenancy** - future enhancement
- **Rate limiting** - future enhancement
- **Encryption at rest** - handled by infrastructure
- **Network security** - handled by infrastructure

### Design Constraints
- **Zero external dependencies** by default
- **Provider-agnostic** authentication (no vendor lock-in)
- **LangGraph native integration** for checkpointing
- **Fast startup** with minimal configuration
- **Enterprise compatibility** with external auth systems

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Authentication Layer
**Purpose**: Verify user identity and extract user context

**Key Design**:
- Generic OIDC implementation works with any provider (Auth0, Keycloak, etc.)
- Optional token validation (can be disabled for externalized auth)
- Supports both delegation and client credentials modes
- Clean development identity when auth is disabled

**Implementation**: `src/api_assistant/services/auth_service.py`

**Related Documentation**: See [Security Overview](security.md) for detailed authentication implementation.

### 2. Access Control Layer
**Purpose**: Ensure users can only access their own threads

**Key Design**:
- **Explicit ownership validation** before any thread operations
- **User-scoped thread IDs** format: `user:{user_id}:{thread_id}`
- **Atomic operations** for thread creation and validation
- **In-memory by default** with Redis backend framework ready

**Critical Security Principle**: Data isolation alone is NOT access control. The system validates thread ownership before any operations.

**Implementation**: `src/api_assistant/services/thread_access_control.py`

### 3. Identity-Aware Services
**Purpose**: Provide user-scoped data isolation across all components

**Components**:
- **Caching**: User-scoped cache keys with configurable TTL
- **Checkpointing**: LangGraph native backends with user isolation
- **Audit**: Dedicated audit logging to separate files with PII masking

**Implementation**: 
- Cache: `src/api_assistant/services/identity_aware_cache.py`
- Checkpointing: `src/api_assistant/services/checkpointing_service.py`
- Audit: `src/api_assistant/services/audit_service.py`

### 4. Audit & Compliance Layer
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive audit trails and compliance features

**Key Design**:
- **Dedicated audit logging** to separate `audit.log` files
- **PII masking** for emails, names, IPs, and sensitive data
- **Identity-resource-action-time** granularity for complete audit trail
- **Compliance ready** for SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001 requirements
- **External audit service** framework for enterprise integration

**Critical Compliance Features**:
- Complete audit trail of all user actions
- Automatic PII protection in all logs and data
- Request lifecycle tracking (start/completion events)
- Configurable audit retention and rotation

**Implementation**: `src/api_assistant/services/audit_service.py` and `src/api_assistant/utils/pii_masking.py`

## Request Flow Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
Request → Extract Token → Validate (optional) → Extract Identity → Create Context
```

### Middleware Chain
```
Request → Log → Auth → User Context → Audit → Route Handler
```

**Key Insight**: Middleware handles authentication and audit, while runtime configuration handles thread access control.

### Thread Access Flow
```
Agent Request → Validate Thread Ownership → Create User-Scoped Thread ID → Proceed
```

**Critical Security Step**: Thread ownership is validated before any LangGraph operations.

## Configuration Strategy

### Environment Variables (Not Complex Dicts)
```bash
# Individual variables for transparency
AUTH_ENABLED=true
AUTH_PROVIDER=standard
AUTH_MODE=client_credentials
CACHE_BACKEND=memory
CHECKPOINTING_BACKEND=memory
AUDIT_BACKEND=memory
```

### Backend Selection
- **Memory**: Zero external dependencies, works immediately
- **Redis**: For caching and access control (framework ready)
- **PostgreSQL**: For checkpointing (LangGraph native)
- **External**: For audit services (framework ready)

**Implementation**: `src/api_assistant/config.py`

## Security Model

### Multi-Layer Defense
1. **Authentication**: JWT-based OIDC with provider support
2. **Authorization**: Thread ownership validation
3. **Data Isolation**: User-scoped namespaces
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete access trail with PII masking
5. **Input Validation**: Multi-layer validation
6. **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance features (SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001)

### Thread Isolation Security
- **Access Validation**: Explicit ownership check before operations
- **Data Isolation**: Natural isolation through `user:{user_id}:{thread_id}` format
- **Cross-User Access**: Prevented by design
- **Audit Trail**: Complete access logging for compliance
- **PII Protection**: Automatic masking of sensitive data in all logs and responses

## Deployment Patterns

### Development (Zero Dependencies)
Everything in-memory - works out-of-the-box. See [Development Guide](development.md).

### Production (External Backends)
Scalable external backends for enterprise deployment. See [Security Overview](security.md).

### Enterprise (Externalized Auth)
Auth handled by infrastructure (Istio/K8s) - disable token validation. See [Security Overview](security.md).
